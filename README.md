# ViMantic Server - Unity

ViMantic is a distributed architecture for the building of semantic maps using mobile robots. It has been designed as a client-server architecture that can run in different devices. It is characterized by:

- Use an ontology as a formal and clear model to accommodate semantic information, including also mechanisms for its manipulation, i.e. insertion, modification or query.
- The model is automatically populated, i.e. it has a method to transform sensory data into high-level information, e.g. by recognizing objects.
- ViMantic uses 3D virtual maps to show the semantic knowledge acquired. The user can use these maps to eliminate wrong knowledge in an intuitive way through a friendly interface.
